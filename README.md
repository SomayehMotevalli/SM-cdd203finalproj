Project: Pridicting hERG and non-hERG blockers 
Project Goal:
The goal of this project is distinguishing between hERG and non-hERG blockers using machine learning models. The project involves feature extraction from SMILES strings, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation of XGBoost and CatBoost classifiers.
Dataset:
For this project, you will be given a set of simulated medical record data (reference) from patients with small cell or non-small cell lung cancer. Write a logistic regression to predict whether a person belongs in one class or another.
The dataset contains 13,445 data points with numerical molecular descriptors and labels (hERG vs. non-hERG blockers). The dataset is not provided in this repository due to licensing and confidentiality restrictions.
